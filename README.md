# Random_Forest_-Fraud_check-
Random Forest for fraud detection involves using a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest on a dataset designed to identify fraudulent activities. In this context, the dataset typically contains features such as transaction amount, location, time, and other relevant information. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (for classification) or the mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees. It's effective for fraud detection as it can handle large datasets with high dimensionality and provides robustness against overfitting. By training the Random Forest model on the fraud check dataset, it learns patterns and anomalies in the data to accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, helping to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
